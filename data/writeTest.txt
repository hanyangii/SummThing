You can see some pretty strange things on a London commute – but not since the Middle Ages has the city seen anything quite like this. In the shadow of Tower Bridge today, 125 noble knights did battle in the name of the Red King.

"I am the one king. The only king! The true king!"

The battle was to promote Clash of Kings – a real-time strategy game for iOS and Android devices. In it, players battle to build an empire, defeating enemies to retain control of their kingdoms. And today the Red King did just that, claiming victory over this monstrous opposition as confused tourists and commuters looked on.

"We're from the US and this is our first day in London. We never thought we’d see anything like this."

"This isn't what Londoners normally do in parks, is it?"

Certainly not, but it was all in a day's work for these men, many of whom are professional battle re-enactors and most of whom survived the battle unscathed.

"Yeah, a slip here and there. Bit of a hip gone, but apart from that, yeah, I survived. And now enjoying a beer.”

Never has a beer been quite so hard-won!
